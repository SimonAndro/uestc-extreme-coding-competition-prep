2021 UESTC extreme coding pre-competition tests

The IEEEXtreme is is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised 
and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete 
in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. IEEEUESTC organizes a similar annual in-school competition. The code in this repo was for the preparation of the in-school competition.
