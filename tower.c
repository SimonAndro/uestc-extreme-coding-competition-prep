 * Description:
 * Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
 * The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,
 * obeying the following simple rules:
 * 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and
 *    placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is
 *    the uppermost disk on a stack.
 * 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 *
 * Approach:
 * We can try solving this problem with n = 1, 2, 3 and follow the pattern
 * recursively.
 * Calling 3 towers with character - A, B and C.
 *
 * Reference:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/
 *
 * Complexity:
 * O(2^n), For n disks 2^n - 1 steps are required.
